Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams.

Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then But now people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing To me limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to doIn like matter of this article In German Suburb Life Goes On Without Cars by Elizabeth Rosenthal states how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europeand up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go Article Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer says how Paris after days of nearrecord pollution enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city It also says how on Monday motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31 The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris This shows how bad cars can be because of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire cityLikewise in the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky says how programs thats set to spread to other countries millions of Columbians hiked biked skated or took the bus to work during a carfree day leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million People like the idea of having carfree days because it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time traffic jams have gone down and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up all due to the fact of having less cars aroundIn conclusion the use of less cars and having carfree days have had a big impact on the environment of cities because it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks and cut down traffic jams Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike or maybe walking somewhere that isnt that far from you and doesnt need the use of a car to get you there To me limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do'"]},"execution_count":21,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df[\"text\"][0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":22,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1447,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710319348845,"user":{"displayName":"1280

Through the use of advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, AI-powered tools are transforming the content creation process in various ways.\n","One significant impact of AI on content writing is the automation of routine tasks such as generating product descriptions, news articles, and social media posts. AI-powered content generation tools can produce high-quality, human-like content at scale, saving time and resources for businesses and content creators. These tools can analyze data trends, user behavior, and preferences to tailor content to specific audiences, leading to more engaging and relevant material.\n","Moreover, AI is enabling personalized content experiences through techniques like content recommendation systems and dynamic content generation. By analyzing user interactions and preferences, AI algorithms can deliver personalized recommendations and create customized content based on individual user profiles. This level of personalization enhances user engagement and satisfaction, ultimately driving better conversion rates and customer loyalty.\n","AI is also optimizing content for search engines through techniques like natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and keyword optimization. AI-powered tools can analyze vast amounts of data to identify relevant keywords, improve readability, and enhance SEO performance. By leveraging AI in content writing, businesses can increase their online visibility and reach a wider audience effectively.\n","However, while AI offers numerous benefits in content writing, it also raises concerns about job displacement and ethical considerations. As AI becomes more proficient in generating content indistinguishable from human-written material, there is a growing debate about the implications for professional writers and the authenticity of AI-generated content. Additionally, ethical considerations around bias in AI algorithms and the potential misuse of automated content creation tools require careful monitoring and regulation.\n","In conclusion, AI is disrupting content writing by streamlining processes, enabling personalization, and optimizing performance. While the impact of AI on content creation is undeniable, it is essential for businesses and creators to leverage these technologies responsibly while upholding ethical standards to ensure a balance between efficiency and authenticity in the digital age.\"\"\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":58,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710322930118,"user":{"displayName":"1280 Saint marc","userId":"10320012136840072615"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"3kzi6j_1f3OA"},"outputs":[],"source":["predicted_text_MNB = pipelineMNB.predict(generated_text)\n","predicted_text_CNB = pipelineCNB.predict(generated_text)\n","predicted_text_SVC = pipelineSVC.predict(generated_text)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":59,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710322931979,"user":{"displayName":"1280 Saint marc","userId":"10320012136840072615"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"cWDZ7pq7ijNk","outputId":"2ce93176-3fc4-4ff5-9f18-93565788d97c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["AI\n","AI\n","AI\n"]}],"source":["print(predicted_text_MNB[0])\n","print(predicted_text_CNB[0])\n","print(predicted_text_SVC[0])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":63,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":496,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710323346816,"user":{"displayName":"1280 Saint marc","userId":"10320012136840072615"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"pPuK0cJCilKr"},"outputs":[],"source":["text = [\"\"\"Gender issues have been increasing in importance through the centuries. In almost every sphere of human activity, there has been a movement towards greater equality between men and women. Although I agree that universities should open their doors to all students alike, in my view, they need not set a fixed limit on the number of men and women they accept in each subject. The bases for my views are psychological and personal.\n","\n","Psychologically-speaking, men and women are simply different, though they have the same potential for greatness. For example, women tend to be more intuitive, sensitive to others and caring. This means they may feel drawn, on the basis of their personalities, to certain kinds of professions such as teaching, nursing, or psychology, even if all fields are open to them. In such a context, it is best for universities to choose the best applicants, regardless of gender.\n","\n","Personally, students need to discover their true calling. This is an individual matter and is not influenced by the universities reserving seats for men or women. For example, if the majority of women shy away from math or engineering, perhaps it has to do with their upbringing, which has influenced their interests. The universities will not be able to reverse this trend, though they should always look out for the most qualified candidates.\n","\n","In conclusion, equality cannot be forced upon people – not in the area of education, employment or family life. Equality is about having choices and those who prove themselves capable will qualify for university, regardless of gender.
